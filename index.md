## about_me

I have over 8 years' experience for natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR) and information extraction (IE) related tasks using machine learning.

I always have the goal to bring in efficiency and effectiveness in the business process that deals with these problems.

Serious productivity hacker. Python and Java enthusiast.
