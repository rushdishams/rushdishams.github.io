## about_me

in charge of research and development of machine-learning based natural language processing (nlp) solutions. 

serious productivity hacker. Python and Java enthusiast.

very much interested in photography and archaeology.

surprisingly (or not), i have a book named [java data science cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/java-data-science-cookbook)! based on which, udemy has a [course](https://www.udemy.com/java-data-science-solutions-big-data-and-visualization/) as well!

i am very selective about adding people in my Facebook and any other social media platform. so, please don't get upset if you do not get any response. but, no worries, let's get connected on a professional platform like- [linked in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rushdishams/).
