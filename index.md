## Summary

I am a data scientist passionate about supporting companies and customers that want to leverage AI/ML to enlighten peoples' lives using on-premise infrastructure or public cloud services. I have been successful in my roles since I am curious to work backwards with problems and communicate ideas, suggestions, and best practices clearly and in a timely manner. The uniqueness about me and my characteristics is that I practice emotional intelligence at work in addition to my combined strength coming from both academia and industry.
